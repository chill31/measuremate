<br>

# Brief
this extension is not any normal convertor. It has all the units required for measuring length (metric and others).
<br>
The units are as follows:
<br>
```
-> mm       (milimeter)
-> cm       (centimeter)
-> m        (meter)
-> km       (kilometer)
-> ft. in'  (feet, inches')
-> yd       (yards)
-> mi       (miles)
```

# Features

there are text boxes (inputs) for each of these and typing in one converts the value of the others according to the conversion.<br>
The feet and inches are separate text boxes in the same line rather than only 1 text box for feet which shows the result in decimal.
You might as well just use another convertor if you get the feet in decimals.
